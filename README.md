💡 Tips
For Firefighters
Respond quickly - Fires spread over time
Use the fire cart - The hose is more effective than water items
Work as a team - Large fires need multiple firefighters
Watch your distance - Stay within 30m of the cart when using hose
Place hydrants strategically - They have a large extinguish radius
For Everyone
Don't start fires near buildings - They spread quickly
Report fires - All players see fire notifications
Stay clear - Fires can hurt you
Don't grief - Starting fires maliciously may be against server rules
